            Hey Jude, don't let me down<br>
            You have found her, now go and get her (let it out and let it in)<br>
            Remember to let her into your heart<br>
            Then you can start to make it better<br>
            So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin<br>
            You're waiting for someone to perform with<br>
            And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do<br>
            The movement you need is on your shoulder<br>
            Na, na, na, naa-naa<br>
            Na, na, naa-naa, yeah<br>
            Hey Jude, don't make it bad<br>
            Take a sad song and make it better<br>
            Remember to let her under your skin<br>
            Then you'll begin to make it<br>
            Better, better, better, better, better, better, oh yeah!<br>
